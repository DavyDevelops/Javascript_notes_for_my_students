// conditional statements, in taking decisions in JS conditional statements evaluate if a condition is true or false before carrying out

const personAge = "goood";

if(personAge >= 18){
    console.log("congrats you are old enough to ride this roller coaster")
} else if(personAge <= 18) {
    console.log("Oh sorry you are not old enough to ride this roller coaster")
} else {
    console.log("thats not a number")
}

//Basically were saying if the variable declared isnt greater than pr equals to 18
// Then run the other block of else code and if it is log something to the console
